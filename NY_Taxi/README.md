# Forecast number of taxi rides in New York districts

## Introduction / Problem statement
In this project we are solving a problem of forecasting number of taxi rides vs. time in each district of New York. To solve it we need to aggregate raw data based on time and area. The aggregate data will represent time series with the number of rides from each district per hour. 

Similar problems arise when you need to forecast sales of a large number of products in a large number of stores, amount of money withdrawn in a network of ATMs, number of visits to different pages of a website, etc.

The data describing yellow taxi rides is taken from www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml

*** In progress ***

This project consists of several parts: 
1. Data preparation
2. Data visualization on the NY map
3. Forecast number of taxi rides with ARIMA
4. In progress...
